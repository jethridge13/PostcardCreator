Postcard Creator by Joshua Ethridge
==============

How to Use
--------------
Once you reach the web page, you will be able to see all of the buttons and functionality. The canvas is on the right half of the screen and
the buttons are on the left. 
 - The "Help" button at the top of the screen shows the Help dialog on the left side of the screen, which can 
subsequently be closed by hitting "Close". 
 - You can upload a picture saved on your local machine by using the "Choose File" button. 
 - Once you are satisfied with your postcard, you can send it by clicking the, "Send as Email" button and entering in the recipient's email address.
 - The, "Add Text" button is how text is added to the canvas. It can be pressed multiple times to allow for several different types of text.
 - The comment section is what text will be drawn on the canvas.
 - The Select Font dropdown chooses the font for that text section.
 - The Size is the height, in pixels, of the text. Accepts a number.
 - The X field is the X coordinate for where to start drawing the text on the canvas. Accepts a number.
 - The Y field is the Y coordinate for where to start drawing the text on the canvas. Accepts a number.
 - The Update button updates the canvas with all font changes.
 - The Remove button removes that selected text from the canvas and removes that font panel from the side bar.


How to Run
--------------
This program was written in Python 3.6.0 on Windows 7 and tested with Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer. To run this program
yourself, the only external library that is needed is the Flask library for Python (http://flask.pocoo.org/). It can be installed by following the
guide on the website or by running the following command on Windows:	

	pip install flask

That will install all the necessary flask files. 
To run the program, make sure that the PostcardCreator.py file is in the same directory as the "static" folder and that the static folder contains
the "index.html" file as well as the "js" and "css" folders. Then, navigate to that directory in command prompt and run the following commands:

	set FLASK_APP=PostcardCreator.py
	flask run

That will start the flask server on "localhost:5000". This also runs the server in testing/debugging mode. To make the server listen to all public
IPs, use this command instead:

	flask run --host=0.0.0.0
